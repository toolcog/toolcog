### Introducing Tool Cognition

Today, we're proud to announce the launch of [Toolcog](https://github.com/toolcog),
the first open source AI framework for Tool Augmented Generation (TAG).

### What is Tool Augmented Generation (TAG)?

Tool Augmented Generation (TAG) is a complementary technique to Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) that further extends the reach of generative AI.
Similar to RAG, which uses vector search to select semantically relevant
context for inclusion in LLM requests, TAG instead uses vector search to
select semantically relevant tools for the LLM to use when generating
responses, thus improving tool usage and reliability by LLMs.

### Humans and Tools

Human eras are defined by advancements in technology and tools. The bronze age.
The iron age.

The information age is a cumulative sum of different tools for knowledge
transfer. Written language. The printing press. Network communications.

Our earliest human ancestors possessed great intelligence long before departing
their caves. Developing sufficient tools, however, enabled them to venture
forward and begin reshaping the world according to their imaginations.

Our current AI landscape is similarly limited. Though AI already possesses
great intelligence, without sufficient tools AI can't really do much. You can
ask an AI about hammers and nails, but today it cannot build you a house.

### AI Tools Landscape

Today, there are millions of software tools built for humans. There are almost
none built for AI.

Within the burgeoning area of AI tool use research, challenges remain around
tool use accuracy and reliability.

For example, researchers from the [Sky Computing lab and the Berkeley AI
Research, or BAIR, Lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15334) noted the following
challenges with LLM function calling:

> Large Language Models (LLMs) have seen an impressive wave of advances
> recently, with models now excelling in a variety of tasks, such as
> mathematical reasoning and program synthesis. However, their potential to
> effectively use tools via API calls remains unfulfilled. This is a
> challenging task even for today's state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4,
> largely due to their inability to generate accurate input arguments and their
> tendency to hallucinate the wrong usage of an API call.

Similarly, [customer experience AI startup Sierra](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12045)
observed these challenges while building AI agents and benchmarking Tool-Agent
User (TAU) interactions:

> At the core, the main results from our experiments demonstrate a critical
> fact: agents built on top of LM function calling lack sufficient consistency
> and rule-following ability to reliably build real-world applications.
> Solving both of these problems can have outsized impact on automating several
> real-world tasks and ensuring smoother human-in-the-loop interaction.

The prospect that AI might one day invent its own tools is certainly intriguing.
But AI already has the faculties—today— to intelligently use the same software
tools that humans and businesses consume everyday. The missing link is
connecting AI models with the bounty of software tools waiting to be harnessed.

### Future of AI Tools

It's our mission at Tool Cognition to safely and responsibly connect generative
AI to the world's best software ecosystems. To turn every API into an AI tool.

The end state looks like this: any routine task that currently requires a
combination of many software tools will be achievable by asking AI to do it
for you. Repetitive tasks will be arranged by telling the AI to periodically
perform them, or to act autonomously in response to particular events. The AI
will leverage many of the same tools you would use to perform the
task—calculators, calendars, databases, analytics, SaaS, and so on. Though AI
will not act via the user interfaces designed for you, but will instead directly
access the underlying APIs that machines use to communicate with each other.

To get there, three things need to happen:

1. LLM tools need to become a first-class programming interface
2. Existing APIs need to be exposed as LLM toolkits
3. Infrastructure software is needed to govern the interactions between
   AI agents and LLM tools

Note that smarter AI models isn't on the list. Improved LLM reasoning and
recall will certainly help. But it's not the limiting factor that many presume
it to be.

### Transform any API into an AI Tool

Today, developers can start using Toolcog to quickly transform their favorite
software tools into powerful AI agents.

Toolcog works by harnessing the programmatic types and comments already present
in software code to generate effective LLM tools for any TypeScript function.
We believe that minimizing the boilerplate and cognitive load needed to develop
LLM tools is essential to bringing large numbers of high quality, reliable tools
online quickly.

Toolcog ships with an interactive read-eval-print loop (REPL) that seamlessly
blends code execution, and tool-enabled AI chat. Developers and researchers can
use the Toolcog REPL to quickly experiment with Tool Augmented Generation,
and validate its accuracy and suitability for any use case.

### Let's Work Together!

We invite anyone interested in actionable AI and autonomous AI agents to join
us in the pursuit of making all the world's software available as LLM tools.
Give the Toolcog REPL a try. Star us on GitHub. And follow us on LinkedIn.
We look forward to seeing the tools and use cases the community creates.
